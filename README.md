These are some codes I wrote in graduate school, during my time in the [Rey Theory Group](https://jila.colorado.edu/arey).

WARNING: the codes in this repository were written for my own graduate research projects.  I had no training in good software engineering or maintenance practices at the time of writing these codes, and therefore make no guarantees of code cleanliness or quality.
